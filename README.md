# recipeApp
I have developed a culinary recipe application.

I have integrated the display of culinary categories on the application's primary interface. Upon selecting any given category, the corresponding list of dishes becomes accessible for perusal.

Upon choosing a particular dish, its comprehensive details are at one's disposal for examination.

Furthermore, within the intricate framework of the detailed interface, a dedicated button has been provisioned to facilitate access to instructional video content sourced from YouTube. This deliberate inclusion aligns with the API-provided culinary data, which encompasses pertinent YouTube links correlating to individual recipes. Upon activation of the said button within the detailed interface, users are seamlessly redirected to the designated link. Notably, said link is capable of initiating within the YouTube application or within a standard web browser interface.
